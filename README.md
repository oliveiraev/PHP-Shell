PHP-Shell
=========

Run PHP statements directly from your browser!

About
-----

PHP Shell put a cloud-based PHP server at your convenience.

Directly from your browser, send PHP statements to interpretation and
evaluation.

* Try PHP 5.4 syntax like ```['easy', 'arrays']``` and
```['direct', 'inference'][0]```.
* Play with namespaces and try manual examples on the same page.
* Test PHP commands even on Chrome OS!! (Firefox plugin coming!)
* Present PHP functions whithout creating files or opening the terminal.
* Less window alternations and better productivity.

How
---

PHP-Shell relies on online servers that propose to analyze PHP snippets.
It downloads the response and presents on a cleaner and sandboxed environment.
Only the **strictly needed** information are sent. No cookies, no login required
**everything ssl crypted**!

Interchangeable!
----------------

Setup your very own parser - the one that supports filesystem and url_fopen -
and use the extension - or even the interface - to play online with your
applications and server.

Seamless
--------

Due to being a _developer tools extension_, it is completely seamless and
non-intrusive. No browser windows, no browser popups nor browser buttons.
Call your developer tools and a shiny new tab will be placed to rock and roll.
